## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After a couple of years of sole development on the ServiceNow platform, I decided to start working on some front end geared projects through Frontend Mentor and realized how much fun it is to work with these technogologies. Currently still only using vanilla CSS.

### Continued development

I want to get back to SCSS for future projects as I remember it helps a lot with structuring code in readable ways.

### Useful resources

-   [Bootstrap Breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/) - This helped me a lot to decide on which breakpoints to set my media queries. I know Bootstrap is not perfect when it comes to handling media queries, but it was definitely a start for me :)
